I recently completed an exciting project where I analyzed supermarket sales data using R to uncover key factors influencing revenue and customer behavior. This hands-on experience strengthened my expertise in data cleaning, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling—skills that are critical for driving data-driven decisions in any business.
✅ Key Highlights of the Project:
Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Leveraged lubridate, dplyr, and tidyverse for efficient preprocessing and date-time corrections.
Missing Data Handling: Applied MICE and Amelia packages for imputation and uncertainty analysis.
Exploratory Analysis & Visualization: Built insightful charts and plots using ggplot2 to reveal trends across branches, product lines, and customer types.
Hypothesis Testing & Regression Modeling: Identified significant predictors of sales (e.g., quantity and unit price) and derived actionable insights for business strategy.
💡 Impact: This project demonstrates how advanced analytics can help businesses optimize sales strategies, improve customer experience, and make informed decisions.
